# My Home Assistant Configuration

Welcome to my HA config! Everything is fairly straight-forward at the moment,
and I hope to keep it that way with well thought-out directory structuring,
so you won't find many comments or much documentation.
However, I'll consider changing this as things get more complicated.

Have fun!
